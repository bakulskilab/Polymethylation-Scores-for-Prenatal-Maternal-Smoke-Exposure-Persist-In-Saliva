# Abstract

**Background**: Prenatal maternal smoking is a difficult to measure prenatal exposure with negative implications for child health.  DNA methylation signatures vary by prenatal maternal smoke exposure in blood and placental samples and can function as a biomarker. However little work has assessed how DNA methylation signatures of prenatal maternal smoking vary across ages, ancestry groups or tissues. Using children in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, we tested if prenatal maternal smoking associates with salivary DNA methylation summary measures, including global methylation, epigenetic age, and polymethylation scores. We assessed the consistency of associations at ages 9 and 15 and their portability across  African, European and Hispanic ancestries. 

**Results**: We created a polymethylation score using coefficients from a metanalysis of prenatal maternal smoke exposure and DNA methylation in newborn cordblood. Prenatal maternal smoking was associated with this polymethylation score () but not epigenetic age or global methylation (). The association with the polymethylation score was consistent at age 9 () and age 15 ().  The direction and magnitude of the association was portable across ancestries at age 9 (African: European: Hispanic), although the association was attenuated among European children at age 15 (African: European: Hispanic). The polymethylation score was reasonably accurate  at classifying prenatal maternal smoke exposure (Area under the curve from receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC age 9: age 15: ), and more accurate than using the top CpG site identified in the metaanalysis, AHRR:CpG05575921 (AUC-ROC age 9:, age 15:, P value). 

**Conclusions**: Prenatal maternal smoking associates with DNA methylation signatures in saliva samples, a clinically practical tissue. Polymethylation scores for prenatal maternal smoking are portable across ancestries and more accurate than some individual CpG sites.  Thus, DNA polymethylation scores from saliva samples could serve as robust and practical clinical biomarkers of prenatal maternal smoke exposure.
