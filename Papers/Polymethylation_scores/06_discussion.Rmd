Restate findings

How do findings fit with previous literature: 
- Performance was worse than the performance of biomarkers using cord blood (AUC: 0.82-0.97), but comparable to performance of biomarkers using peripheral blood (AUC 0.72... NOTE: I don't think this was adjusted for anything else, i.e. if any other predictors were included in the model--if not, then ours is worse). 

What does our study add: 


Strengths: 

- Large sample size and longitudinal measures 

- 


Limitations: 

- Available coefficients for construction of scores were from blood, primarily European ancestry meta-analysis

- Used maternal self report as opposed to serum cotinine levels as exposure measurement - exposure misclassification/information bias

- Possibility for selection bias into cohort due to live birth bias 

- Residual confounding is always possible.
