# Introduction

Prenatal maternal smoking is associated with DNA methylation in children [@Joubert:2016ue]. Thus, summary metrics of DNA methylation could serve as reliable and specific biomarkers of prenatal smoke exposure.

```


***But some gaps remain...!***

1.  ![](Images/Icons/noun_blood%20sample_4011680.svg) **Tissue:** Previous studies have measured methylation in peripheral or cord blood. **Are the same methylation markers of prenatal maternal smoking also present in saliva, an easier to collect sample?**

2.  ![](Images/Icons/noun_ethnicity_94199.svg) **Ancestry:** Previous study populations have been of European descent. **Are methylation markers of prenatal maternal smoking consistent across different ancestry groups?**

3.  ![](Images/Icons/noun_Life%20Stages_398930.svg) **Time:** Previous study populations have examined methylation at a single cross-sectional time point in infancy or early childhood. **Are methylation markers of prenatal maternal smoking persistent as children age?**

***We tested the association between prenatal maternal smoking and DNA methylation summary measures in sequential saliva samples from a diverse-ancestry, longitudinal birth cohort***

# Methods

The **Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study** is a *longitudinal* cohort of US children followed from birth until 22 years of age.

-   *Smoking during pregnancy*: Maternal interview at birth.

-   *Methylation*: Saliva samples from 9 and 15 year visit; 450K chip.

-   *Covariates*: Maternal alcohol and drug use during pregnancy (birth interview), income-to-poverty ratio (birth), maternal postnatal smoking (interviews), child smoking (interviews), child's genetic ancestry categorization (principal components of genetic data), cell type proportions (estimated from methylation data)

## Methylation summary measures

We used several common summary measures of methylation data, including global methylation and methylation clocks. We also created several prenatal maternal smoking specific polymethylation scores, using regression coefficients from @Joubert:2016ue.

**Polymethylation scores**

For $i$ individuals with $j$ CpG sites measured:

$$
Score_i=\sum \color{darkgreen} {\beta_{regression_{j}}} *  \color{darkblue} {t(B_{CpG_{ij}})}
$$ 

[Regression coefficients for CpG sites from a previous epigenome wide association analysis]{style="color: darkgreen;"}<sup>a</sup> are used to weight [each individual's methylation beta value at that CpG site]{style="color: darkblue;"}<sup>b</sup>. These weighted methylation values are summed across all CpG sites.

```{=html}
<div style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom:5px;">

<span style="color: darkgreen; font-size:18px"><sup>a</sup>We benchmarked 4 different regression coefficients made available in @</span>

<span style="color: darkblue; font-size:18px"><sup>b</sup>Methylation beta values are continuous and bounded at $[0, 1]$. Concerned this might upweight the importance of highly methylated probes, we benchmarked 3 different transformations (t()) of methylation beta values: no transform, mean-centered and z-score.</span>

# Results

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

```{r data read and set up}

```

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}

```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:15,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
